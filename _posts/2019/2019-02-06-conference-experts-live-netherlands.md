Je suis heureux de vous annoncer que je donnerai une session avec mon ami Samuel Erskine, le 6 Juin 2019, à Experts Live Netherlands. Voici le contenu de la session:

> Track, Inventory and patch VMs in Azure (Windows or Linux) without SCCM and with zero infrastructure
> 
> SCCM is great for your full systems management needs but why would you use it in Azure. In this session Sam Erskine (MVP) and Florent Appointaire (MVP) take you through the native capabilities in Azure (available to you) to meet your needs in the areas of change tracking, inventory management and patch management. these capabilities have been significantly enhanced over the last year. Easy to set up in just 1 click; well and just a few fields to fill in the form before the click. This is a zero to hero session ; SCCM gurus have no fear, there is plenty of room in Azure for SCCM management if you still want to use your favourite tool.
